			"body":"Punching holes in objects reveals the backgrounds that support their existence. Put enough holes in something and it will lose legibility and could eventually fall apart. Our sight is full of gaps that only become visible once we stop and search for them. What happens when we're looking for holes?"

Despite knowing that minimal art was made by men who did terrible things, that it is still used to propagate insular art world discussions and flows of money, and that it offers nothing obvious in terms of content or emotion, why am I constantly drawn to it?"

			"body":"In the Unity 3D game engine the default cube is grey and 1x1x1 unit. In VR and AR applications, the Unity unit translates to a meter in IRL space. For today's game engines rendering a cube is trivial, it can happen in a fraction of a second. Crocheting the same cube with yarn took me a year and a half. The inside is empty. Just like the digital 3D model it is a closed surface of faces. It takes 2 people to hold it up and see the 3 dimensional cube shape, and even then it sags."

			"body":"Cornhole is a popular game for backyards and tailgates in the Midwest. Players take turns tossing beanbags and attempting to land them on a flat, inclined wooden board or, ideally, in the hole cut into the top half of the board. In this video I took the place of the board, literalizing the homophobic and sexual implications of the name 'cornhole'."

They contain character skins, voice lines, and graffiti tags that are only cosmetic, they don't change the dynamics of how the game is played. This was about a years worth of boxes gained after many hours of play."

			"body":"The physical actions of labor while working on a computer are so minimal that we tend to consider it an entirely mental pursuit. By creating the a giant computer mouse shell out of steel, with a compartment to insert a real, working computer mouse, I turned the simple act of moving a mouse into a full-body workout. In the video, I use this giant mouse shell to play a game I created in Processing where I have to mouse over red pop-up notifications in a short, predetermined amount of time."

It is impossible to always keep their outlines visible; they emerge from and return to the background, which is only a few shades lighter. Our eyes, when presented with an undifferentiated field of white light, start to trick us into seeing shapes and forms in order to try and make sense of the space. These patterns of vision tend to follow the artifacts created by the imperfections of the headset, usually forgotten in the immersion of virtual reality environments."

As the scenes progress, the player's vantage point shifts in relation to the controllers and the target. Eventually, they share the target's perspective and are able to shoot at themselves from a distance."

			"info":"Virtual Reality - 2017",
			"body":"This piece primarily uses the camera on the front of the Vive Virtual Reality headset, which is intended to give users a quick view of the physical space they are standing in for safety purposes. When this camera feed takes up the entire field of view in the headset, it presents a warped view of the physical space that the user is standing in. This is partly because it is constructed from a single camera instead of two eyes. This feed can also be multiplied, used as textures for 3D geometry, or stretched and rotated to create abstracted views of what the user would be seeing if they didn't have the headset on."

			"body":"This installation consists of 4 pedestal-controllers, each embedded with a joystick and arcade button, 4 pedestal-seats, and a T.V. pedestal all coated in the same paint as the gallery walls. The game consists of a series of scenes where, generally, there are 4 pedestals which correspond to the 4 pedestal-controllers. The scenes change between omniscient views, multiplayer 'split-screens', first-person views from the pedestals' POV, and layered camera views. The pedestals can collide, jump, expand, spin, fly, multiply, and destroy each other."

			"body":"What's the difference between playing a record and playing a videogame? rec. is a single-button game which considers the form and physicality of vinyl record players. Traces of objects' movement are built up and wiped away as the objects spin, crash, pulsate, and are shot across the screen. It consists of a series of scenes which are punctuated by short pauses during which a sphere spins on the screen with a quiet noise, mimicking the empty space between vinyl tracks."

			"body":"Tony Smith said of his Die sculpture, \"I didn’t make a drawing; I just picked up the phone and ordered it.\" A 6'x6'x6' virtual black cube sits on the ground in the middle of the virtual reality play area, which can range from 6'6\" x 5' to 11'5\" x 11'5\". While standing inside the cube only solid black is visible. When looking at the cube from outside its boundaries, the environment's background is taken from the camera which is on the headset, so that it seems to be sitting in the physical space that the user is standing in. It is hard to get a good vantage point of the cube from such a constricted space and it doesn't seem to match correctly with the camera feed background."

			"body":"This game is a series of short scenes which contain exactly one cube, monotonous sounds, and any number of cameras. These camera views are layered on top of each other as a literal instantiation of Cubism. By rotating the cube, the player's understanding of this simple form falls apart and opens up in surprising ways."

Unity 3D has built-in assumptions that people will use it in order to create landscapes for characters/players to inhabit. I aim to examine these defaults and the ways that 3D spaces are constructed by using these tools as found objects."
