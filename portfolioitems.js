			"body":"In the Unity 3D game engine the default cube is grey and 1x1x1 unit. In VR and AR applications, the Unity unit translates to a meter in IRL space. For today's game engines rendering a cube is trivial, it can happen in a fraction of a second. Crocheting the same cube with yarn took me a year and a half. The inside is empty. Just like the digital 3D model it is a closed surface of faces. It takes 2 people to hold it up and see the 3 dimensional cube shape, and even then it sags."

The shapes themselves will also sometimes rotate and become askew, in reference primarily to the painting The Ambassadors, by Hans Holbein the Younger, which features a skull that can only be seen properly by standing to the side of the painting because of how it has been distorted."

			"body":"Tony Smith said of his Die sculpture, \"I didnâ€™t make a drawing; I just picked up the phone and ordered it.\" A 6'x6'x6' virtual black cube sits on the ground in the middle of the virtual reality play area, which can range from 6'6\" x 5' to 11'5\" x 11'5\". While standing inside the cube only solid black is visible. When looking at the cube from outside its boundaries, the environment's background is taken from the camera which is on the headset, so that it seems to be sitting in the physical space that the user is standing in. It is hard to get a good vantage point of the cube from such a constricted space and it doesn't seem to match correctly with the camera feed background."

The player will be able to move the mouse to play the displayed strings, which sound with samples from various string instruments. The completed game will also include samples of Yiddish poems which will also be played with, as the name for the data type in computer science for text is a string. This word play is common in Kabbalistic practice, which takes sacred texts as something to be subjected to various algorithms to produce new readings."

			"body":"This installation consists of 4 pedestal-controllers, each embedded with a joystick and arcade button, 4 pedestal-seats, and a T.V. pedestal all coated in the same paint as the gallery walls. The game consists of a series of scenes where, generally, there are 4 pedestals which correspond to the 4 pedestal-controllers. The scenes change between omniscient views, multiplayer 'split-screens', first-person views from the pedestals' POV, and layered camera views. The pedestals can collide, jump, expand, spin, fly, multiply, and destroy each other."

These camera views are layered on top of each other as a literal instantiation of Cubism. By rotating the cube, the player's understanding of this simple form falls apart and opens up in surprising ways."
