					<br><br>

					Currently I am working at Osmo as a Technical Artist for their <a href="https://www.playosmo.com/en/reading-adventure/">Reading Adventure</a> game, where I am working on editing special effects, animation time lines, and computer vision tagging. 

					<br><br><br><br>

					I'm recently worked on an interactive VR film called <a href="https://susanaruiz.org/takeactiongames-mountains">Mountains After Mountains</a> with filmmakers <a href="https://susanaruiz.org/">Susana Ruiz</a> and Huy Truong centered on a monologue written and performed by Amy Mihyang Ginther. The experience includes 3D scans and volumetic recordings of the monologue mixed in with colorful, cartoony environments. The project was developed in Unity using the Oculus Rift and was designed to be screened at film festivals.

					While working at Gallgher & Associates I collaborated with designers to imagine possibilities for deploying emerging technology in museum settings, primarily prototyping on the Hololens AR headset and the (sadly already defunct) Google Tango AR tablet. Some of these experiments included feeding and petting a dinosaur in VR, an interactive AR tour of our office, a hypothetical museum object overlay interface, and artistic experiments with a sculptor.

					I've been working in Unity since 2014 on making experimental games for <a href="https://danmmfa.ucsc.edu/portfolio/patrick-stefaniak/">art gallery settings</a> and <a href="https://sutopat.itch.io">distributing them online.</a>

					These are some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ar/209288117901364/">Instagram filters</a> I made in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ar/1287073681730353/">Spark AR</a>, connected to my MFA thesis piece "A few ways of being a cube".

					At <a href="https://gallagherdesign.com/">Gallagher & Associates</a> I worked with UX/UI, exhibit, and content designers to build touch screen interactives for the <a href="https://gallagherdesign.com/projects/illinois-holocaust-museum/">Illinois Holocaust Museum</a> in Skokie, Illinois and <a href="https://gallagherdesign.com/projects/mississippi-arts-entertainment-experience-the-max/">Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience</a> in Meridian, Mississippi. These were built using HTML5/SASS, React.js, and pixi.js.

					In my time working at Indiana University in the Hamilton Luger School of Global and International Studies I had the opportunity to create <a href="https://nalrc.github.io/src/map.html">smaller games and prototypes</a> focused on outreach for some of the language programs.
